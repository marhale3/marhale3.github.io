<span style="font-size:11pt;">
<p>Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a &le; b &le; c. 
(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).<BR />
The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).
</p>

</div>
<p>
The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.<BR />
It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.<BR />
However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.
</p>
<p>
How many triangles ABC with perimeter&le;100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?
