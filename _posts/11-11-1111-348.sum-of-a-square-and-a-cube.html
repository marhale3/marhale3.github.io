<p>Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.</p>

<p>Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in <b>exactly</b> 4 different ways.<BR/>
For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:</p>
<p>2285<sup>2</sup> + 20<sup>3</sup><br/>
2223<sup>2</sup> + 66<sup>3</sup><br/>
1810<sup>2</sup> + 125<sup>3</sup><br/>
1197<sup>2</sup> + 156<sup>3</sup></p>
 
<p>Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.</p>
