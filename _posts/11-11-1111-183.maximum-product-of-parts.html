<p>Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into <var>k</var> equal parts, <var>r</var> = N/<var>k</var>, so that N = <var>r</var> + <var>r</var> + ... + <var>r</var>.<br />
Let P be the product of these parts, P = <var>r</var> &times; <var>r</var> &times; ... &times; <var>r</var> = <var>r</var><sup><var>k</var></sup>.</p>

<p>For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.2<sup>5</sup> = 51.53632.</p>

<p>Let M(N) = P<sub>max</sub> for a given value of N.</p>

<p>It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to P<sub>max</sub> = (11/4)<sup>4</sup>; that is, M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.</p>

<p>However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.</p>

<p>Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is a terminating decimal.</p>

<p>For example, &Sigma;D(N) for 5 &le; N &le; 100 is 2438.</p>

<p>Find &Sigma;D(N) for 5 &le; N &le; 10000.</p>
