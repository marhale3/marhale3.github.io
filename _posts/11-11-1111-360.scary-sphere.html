<P>
Given two points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>2</sub>) in three dimensional space, the <b>Manhattan distance</b>  between those points is defined as <BR /> |x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>|+|y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>|+|z<sub>1</sub>-z<sub>2</sub>|.

Let C(<var>r</var>) be a sphere with radius <var>r</var> and center in the origin O(0,0,0).<BR />
Let I(<var>r</var>) be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the surface of C(<var>r</var>).<BR />
Let S(<var>r</var>) be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of I(<var>r</var>) to the origin O.
