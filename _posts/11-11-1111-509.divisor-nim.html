<P>
Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.<BR />
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules somewhat.<BR />
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a <dfn title="a proper divisor of n is a divisor of n smaller than n">proper divisor</dfn> of the number of stones present in the pile.<BR /> E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only 1,2,3,4,6,8 or 12 stones from that pile.<BR />
So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.<BR />
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.<BR />
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.</P>
<P>
The triple (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>) indicates the number of stones in the three piles.<BR />
Let <var>S</var>(<var>n</var>) be the number of winning positions for the next player for 1 &le; <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> &le; <var>n</var>.<BR />
<var>S</var>(10) = 692 and <var>S</var>(100) = 735494.</P/
<P>
Find <var>S</var>(123456787654321) modulo 1234567890.
