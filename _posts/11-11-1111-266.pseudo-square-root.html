<P>
The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.<BR />
The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.<BR />
We shall call the largest divisor of an integer <var>n</var> that does not exceed the square root of <var>n</var> the pseudo square root (PSR) of <var>n</var>.<BR />
It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.
</P>
<P>
Let <var>p</var> be the product of the primes below 190.<BR />
Find PSR(<var>p</var>) mod 10<sup>16</sup>.
