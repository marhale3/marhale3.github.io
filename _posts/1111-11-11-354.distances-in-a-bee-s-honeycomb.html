<p>Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.</p>

<div align='center'>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/project/images/p354_bee_honeycomb.png" />
</div>


<p>
One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.<br />
For a positive real number <var>L</var>, let B(<var>L</var>) count the cells with distance <var>L</var> from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. <br />
For example, B(&radic;3) = 6, B(&radic;21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.</p>

<p>Find the number of <var>L</var> &le; 5&middot;10<sup>11</sup> such that B(<var>L</var>) = 450.</p>
