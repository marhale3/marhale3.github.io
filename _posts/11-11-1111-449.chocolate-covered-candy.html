<P>Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation: b<sup>2</sup><var>x</var><sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup><var>y</var><sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup><var>z</var><sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>.
</P>
<P>
Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.
<table class="formula"><tr>
    <td>If a=1 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is 
    </td>
    <td><table class="frac">
        <tr><td>28</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="overline">3</td></tr>
        </table>
    </td>
    <td>&pi; mm<sup>3</sup></td>
</tr></table>
If a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm<sup>3</sup>.
</P>
<P>
Find the amount of chocolate in mm<sup>3</sup> required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm. Give your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</P>
