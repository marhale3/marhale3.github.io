<p>Let <var>n</var> be a positive integer. Consider <b>nim</b> positions where:<ul>
<li>There are <var>n</var> non-empty piles.
<li>Each pile has size less than 2<sup><var>n</var></sup>.
<li>No two piles have the same size.
</ul></p>
<p>Let W(<var>n</var>) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above
conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and W(100) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007 = 384777056.
</p>
<p>Find W(10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.
</p>
