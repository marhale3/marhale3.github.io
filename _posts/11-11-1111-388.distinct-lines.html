<P>
Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 &le; a,b,c &le; N.
</P>
<P>
From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.<BR />
Let D(N) be the number of <i>distinct</i> such lines.
</P>
<P>
You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.
</P><P>
Find D(10<sup>10</sup>). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.
