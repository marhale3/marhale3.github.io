<p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square &quot;hole&quot; so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>
<p>Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="project/images/p173_square_laminas.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<p>If <var>t</var> represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that <var>t</var> = 8 is type L(1) and <var>t</var> = 32 is type L(2).</p>
<p>Let N(<var>n</var>) be the number of <var>t</var> &le; 1000000 such that <var>t</var> is type L(<var>n</var>); for example, N(15) = 832.</p>
<p>What is &sum; N(<var>n</var>) for 1 &le; <var>n</var> &le; 10?</p>
