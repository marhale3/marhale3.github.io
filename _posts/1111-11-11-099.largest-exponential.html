<p>Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2<sup>11</sup> and 3<sup>7</sup> is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 &lt; 3<sup>7</sup> = 2187.</p>
<p>However, confirming that 632382<sup>518061</sup> &gt; 519432<sup>525806</sup> would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.</p>
<p>Using <a href="{{ site.url }}/project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt">base_exp.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.</p>
<p class='info'>NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.</p>
