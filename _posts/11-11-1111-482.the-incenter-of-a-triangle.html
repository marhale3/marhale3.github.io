<P>
ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p.<BR />
The segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well. 
</P>
<P>
Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| + |IC|. 
</P>
<P>
Let S(P) = &sum;L for all such triangles where p &le; P. For example, S(10<sup>3</sup>) = 3619.
</P>
<P>
Find S(10<sup>7</sup>).
