<p>Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:</p>
<blockquote>1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup><br />
8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup><br />
9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup></blockquote>
<p class='info'>As 1 = 1<sup>4</sup> is not a sum it is not included.</p>
<p>The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.</p>
