<P>
The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6.<BR />
The sum of the squares of these numbers is 1+4+9+36=50.
</P>
<P>
Let sigma2(n) represent the sum of the squares of the divisors of n.
Thus sigma2(6)=50.
</P>
Let SIGMA2 represent the summatory function of sigma2, that is SIGMA2(n)=&sum;sigma2(i) for i=1 to n.<BR />
The first 6 values of SIGMA2 are: 1,6,16,37,63 and 113.
</P>
<P>
Find SIGMA2(10<sup>15</sup>) modulo 10<sup>9</sup>. 
</P>
