<p>
The sequence 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, 653, 1201 ...<br />
is defined by T<sub>1</sub> = T<sub>2</sub> = T<sub>3</sub> = 1 and T<sub><var>n</var></sub> = T<sub><var>n</var>-1</sub> + T<sub><var>n</var>-2</sub> + T<sub><var>n</var>-3</sub>.
</p>
<p>
It can be shown that 27 does not divide any terms of this sequence.<br />In fact, 27 is the first odd number with this property.</p>
<p>
Find the 124<sup>th</sup> odd number that does not divide any terms of the above sequence.</p>
