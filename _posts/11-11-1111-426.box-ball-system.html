<P>
Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.
</P>
<P>
A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.
</P>
<P>
After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.

A system like this is called a <B>Box-Ball System</B> or <B>BBS</B> for short.
</P>
<P>
It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of <B>occupied boxes</B> evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.

We define the sequence {<var>t</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>}:<BR />
<ul>
<li><var>s</var><sub>0</sub> = 290797
<li><var>s</var><sub><var>k</var>+1</sub> = <var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub><sup>2</sup> mod 50515093
<li><var>t</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> = (<var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> mod 64) + 1
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Starting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>), the final state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].<BR />
Starting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10 000 000</sub>), find the final state.<BR />
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>) is your answer.
