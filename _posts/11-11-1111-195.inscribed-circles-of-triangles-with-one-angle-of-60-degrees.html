<p>Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a 60-degree triangle.<br />
Let <var>r</var> be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.</p>
<p>There are 1234 60-degree triangles for which <var>r</var> &le; 100.
<br />Let T(<var>n</var>) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which <var>r</var> &le; <var>n</var>, so<br />
 T(100) = 1234,&nbsp; T(1000) = 22767, and&nbsp; T(10000) = 359912.</p>

<p>Find T(1053779).</p>
