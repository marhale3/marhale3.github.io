<p>A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example, 15 = 3 &times; 5; 9 = 3 &times; 3; 12 = 2 &times; 2 &times; 3.</p>

<p>There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors:
4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.</p>

<p>How many composite integers, <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>8</sup>, have precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?</p>
