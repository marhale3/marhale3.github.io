<p>Starting in the top left corner of a 2&times;2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="project/images/p015.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<p>How many such routes are there through a 20&times;20 grid?</p>
