<P>
Two positive numbers A and B are said to be <i>connected</i> (denoted by "A &harr; B") if one of these conditions holds:<BR />
(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 &harr; 173.<BR />
(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 &harr; 223 and 123 &harr; 23.
</P>
<P>
We call a prime P a <i>2's relative</i> if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.
</P>
<P>
For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:<BR />
2 &harr; 3 &harr; 13 &harr; 113 &harr; 103 &harr; 107 &harr; 127<BR />
However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.
</P>
<P>
Let F(N) be the sum of the primes &le; N which are not 2's relatives.<BR />
We can verify that F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 431 and F(10<sup>4</sup>) = 78728.
</P>
<P>
Find F(10<sup>7</sup>).
