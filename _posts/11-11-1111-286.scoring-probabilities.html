<p>Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance <var>x</var> is exactly (1&thinsp;-&nbsp;<sup><var>x</var></sup>/<sub><var>q</var></sub>), where <var>q</var> is a real constant greater than 50.</p>

<p>During each practice run, she takes shots from distances <var>x</var>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, <var>x</var>&thinsp;=&thinsp;2, ..., <var>x</var>&thinsp;=&thinsp;50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2&thinsp;% chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.</p>

<p>Find <var>q</var> and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.</p>
