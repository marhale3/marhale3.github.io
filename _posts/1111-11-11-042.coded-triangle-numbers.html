<p>The <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, <i>t<sub>n</sub></i> = &frac12;<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>
<p>By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = <i>t</i><sub>10</sub>. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.</p>
<p>Using <a href="{{ site.url }}/project/resources/p042_words.txt">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?</p>
