<p>For an integer <var>n</var> &ge; 4, we define the <i>lower prime square root</i> of <var>n</var>, denoted by lps(<var>n</var>), as the largest prime &le; &radic;<var>n</var> and the <i>upper prime square root</i> of <var>n</var>, ups(<var>n</var>), as the smallest prime &ge; &radic;<var>n</var>.</p>
<p>So, for example, lps(4) = 2 = ups(4), lps(1000) = 31, ups(1000) = 37.<br />
Let us call an integer <var>n</var> &ge; 4 <i>semidivisible</i>, if one of lps(<var>n</var>) and ups(<var>n</var>) divides <var>n</var>, but not both.</p>

<p>The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding 15 is 30, the numbers are 8, 10 and 12.<br /> 15 is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both lps(15) = 3 and ups(15) = 5.<br />
As a further example, the sum of the 92 semidivisible numbers up to 1000 is 34825.</p>

<p>What is the sum of all semidivisible numbers not exceeding 999966663333 ?</p>
