<P>
A rectilinear grid is an orthogonal grid where the spacing between the gridlines does not have to be equidistant.<BR />
An example of such grid is logarithmic graph paper.
</p>
<P>
Consider rectilinear grids in the Cartesian coordinate system with the following properties:<br /><ul><li>The gridlines are parallel to the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.</li><li>There are N+2 vertical and N+2 horizontal gridlines. Hence there are (N+1) x (N+1) rectangular cells.</li><li>The equations of the two outer vertical gridlines are x = -1 and x = 1.</li><li>The equations of the two outer horizontal gridlines are y = -1 and y = 1.</li><li>The grid cells are colored red if they overlap with the <dfn title="The unit circle is the circle that has radius 1 and is centered at the origin">unit circle</dfn>, black otherwise.</li></ul>For this problem we would like you to find the postions of the remaining N inner horizontal and N inner vertical gridlines so that the area occupied by the red cells is minimized.

E.g. here is a picture of the solution for N = 10:

</p>
The area occupied by the red cells for N = 10 rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point is 3.3469640797.

<p>
Find the positions for N = 400.<BR /> 
Give as your answer the area occupied by the red cells rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
