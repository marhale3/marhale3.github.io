<P>
An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or white.<BR/> 
The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following rules:<BR/>
- if it is on a black square, it flips the color of the square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.<BR/>
- if it is on a white square, it flips the color of the square to black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.<BR/>

<P>
Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after 10<sup>18</sup> moves of the ant?
