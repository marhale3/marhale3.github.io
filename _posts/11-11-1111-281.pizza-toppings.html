<p>You are given a pizza (perfect circle) that has been cut into <var>m</var>&middot;<var>n</var> equal pieces and you want to have exactly one topping on each slice.</p>

<p>Let <var>f</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>) denote the number of ways you can have toppings on the pizza with <var>m</var> different toppings (<var>m</var>&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;2), using each topping on exactly <var>n</var> slices (<var>n</var>&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;1). <br />Reflections are considered distinct, rotations are not. </p>

<p>Thus, for instance, <var>f</var>(2,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, <var>f</var>(2,2)&thinsp;=&thinsp;<var>f</var>(3,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;2 and <var>f</var>(3,2)&thinsp;=&thinsp;16. <br /><var>f</var>(3,2) is shown below:</p>
