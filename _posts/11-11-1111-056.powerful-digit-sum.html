<p>A googol (10<sup>100</sup>) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100<sup>100</sup> is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.</p>
<p>Considering natural numbers of the form, <i>a<sup>b</sup></i>, where <i>a, b</i> &lt; 100, what is the maximum digital sum?</p>
