<p>A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(<i>k</i>) to be a repunit of length <i>k</i>.</p>
<p>For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11&times;41&times;271&times;9091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414.</p>
<p>Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
