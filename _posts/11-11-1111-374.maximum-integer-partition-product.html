<P>An integer partition of a number <var>n</var> is a way of writing <var>n</var> as a sum of positive integers.</P>

<P>Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same.
A partition of <var>n</var> into <b>distinct parts</b> is a partition of <var>n</var> in which every part occurs at most once.</P>

<P>The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:
<BR/>5, 4+1 and 3+2.</P>

<P>Let f(<var>n</var>) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of <var>n</var> into distinct parts and let m(<var>n</var>) be the number of elements of any such partition of <var>n</var> with that product.</P>

<P>So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.</P>

<P>For <var>n</var>=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.
<BR/>And their product, f(10)&middot;m(10) = 30&middot;3 = 90</P>

<P>It can be verified that
<BR/>&sum;f(<var>n</var>)&middot;m(<var>n</var>) for 1 &le; <var>n</var> &le; 100 = 1683550844462.</P>

<P>Find &sum;f(<var>n</var>)&middot;m(<var>n</var>) for 1 &le; <var>n</var> &le; 10<sup>14</sup>.
<BR/>Give your answer modulo 982451653, the 50 millionth prime.</P>
