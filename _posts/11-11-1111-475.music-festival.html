<p>12<var>n</var> musicians participate at a music festival. On the first day, they form 3<var>n</var> quartets and practice all day.</p>
<p>It is a disaster. At the end of the day, all musicians decide they will never again agree to play with any member of their quartet.</p>
<p>On the second day, they form 4<var>n</var> trios, each musician avoiding his previous quartet partners.</p>

<p>Let <var>f</var>(12<var>n</var>) be the number of ways to organize the trios amongst the 12<var>n</var> musicians.</p>
<p>You are given <var>f</var>(12) = 576 and <var>f</var>(24) mod 1 000 000 007 = 509089824.</p>

<p>Find <var>f</var>(600) mod 1 000 000 007.</p>
