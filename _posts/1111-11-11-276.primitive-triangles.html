<p>Consider the triangles with integer sides a, b and c with a &le; b &le; c.<br />
An integer sided triangle (a,b,c) is called primitive if <dfn title=" gcd(a,b,c)=gcd(a,gcd(b,c))"> gcd(a,b,c)</dfn>=1. <br />
How many primitive integer sided triangles exist with a perimeter not exceeding 10 000 000?
