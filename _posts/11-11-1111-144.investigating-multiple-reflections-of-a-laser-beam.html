<p>In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.</p>
<p>The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = 100</p>
<p>The section corresponding to &minus;0.01 &le; <i>x</i> &le; +0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.</p>
