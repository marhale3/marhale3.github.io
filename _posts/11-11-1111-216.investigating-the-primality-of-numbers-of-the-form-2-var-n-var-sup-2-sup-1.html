answer: -1

<p>Consider numbers <var>t</var>(<var>n</var>) of the form <var>t</var>(<var>n</var>) = 2<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>-1 with <var>n</var> &gt; 1.<br />
The first such numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127 and 161.<br />
It turns out that only 49 = 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime.<br />
For <var>n</var> &le; 10000 there are 2202 numbers <var>t</var>(<var>n</var>)  that are prime.</p>

<p>How many numbers <var>t</var>(<var>n</var>) are prime for <var>n</var> &le; 50,000,000 ?</p>
