<p>The positive integers, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that <i>n</i> is a positive integer, the equation, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> &minus; <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> &minus; <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i>, has exactly one solution when <i>n</i> = 20:</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>13<sup>2</sup> &minus; 10<sup>2</sup> &minus; 7<sup>2</sup> = 20</p>
<p>In fact there are twenty-five values of <i>n</i> below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.</p>
<p>How many values of <i>n</i> less than fifty million have exactly one solution?</p>
