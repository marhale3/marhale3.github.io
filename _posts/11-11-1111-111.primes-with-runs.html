<p>Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111</p>
<p>We shall say that M(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an <i>n</i>-digit prime where <i>d</i> is the repeated digit, N(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the number of such primes, and S(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the sum of these primes.</p>
<p>So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for <i>d</i> = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.</p>
<p>In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.</p>
<div style='text-align:center;'>
<table align='center' border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='5'>
<tr>
<td><b>Digit, <i>d</i></b></td>
<td><b>M(4, <i>d</i>)</b></td>
<td><b>N(4, <i>d</i>)</b></td>
<td><b>S(4, <i>d</i>)</b></td>

</div>
<p>For <i>d</i> = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, <i>d</i>) is 273700.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all S(10, <i>d</i>).</p>
