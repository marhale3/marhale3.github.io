<p>We define a <i>block</i> to be a rectangle with a height of 1 and an integer-valued length. Let a <i>castle</i> be a configuration of stacked blocks.</p>

<p>Given a game grid that is <var>w</var> units wide and <var>h</var> units tall, a castle is generated according to the following rules:</p>


<ol>
<li>Blocks can be placed on top of other blocks as long as nothing sticks out past the edges or hangs out over open space.</li>
<li>All blocks are aligned/snapped to the grid.</li>
<li>Any two neighboring blocks on the same row have at least one unit of space between them.</li>
<li>The bottom row is occupied by a block of length <var>w</var>.</li>
<li>The maximum achieved height of the entire castle is exactly <var>h</var>.</li>
<li>The castle is made from an even number of blocks.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following is a sample castle for <var>w</var>=8 and <var>h</var>=5:</p>

<p align=center><img src={{ site.baseurl }}project/images/p502_castles.png></p>

<p>Let F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>) represent the number of valid castles, given grid parameters <var>w</var> and <var>h</var>.</p>

<p>For example, F(4,2) = 10, F(13,10) = 3729050610636, F(10,13) = 37959702514, and F(100,100) mod 1 000 000 007 = 841913936.</p>

<p>Find (F(10<sup>12</sup>,100) + F(10000,10000) + F(100,10<sup>12</sup>)) mod 1 000 000 007.</p>
