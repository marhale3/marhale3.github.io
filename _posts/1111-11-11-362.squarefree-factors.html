<P>
Consider the number 54.<BR />
54 can be factored in 7 distinct ways into one or more factors larger than 1:<BR />
54, 2&times;27, 3&times;18, 6&times;9, 3&times;3&times;6, 2&times;3&times;9 and 2&times;3&times;3&times;3.<BR />
If we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain: 3&times;3&times;6 and 2&times;3&times;3&times;3.

<P>
Let's call Fsf(<var>n</var>) the number of ways <var>n</var> can be factored into one or more squarefree factors larger than 1, so
Fsf(54)=2.
</P>
<P>
Let S(<var>n</var>) be &sum;Fsf(<var>k</var>) for <var>k</var>=2 to <var>n</var>.
</P>
<P>
S(100)=193.
</P>
<P>
Find S(10 000 000 000).
