<p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square &quot;hole&quot; so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}project/images/p173_square_laminas.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<p>With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.</p>
<p>Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be formed?</p>
