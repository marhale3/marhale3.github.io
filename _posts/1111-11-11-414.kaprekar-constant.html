<P>
6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.<BR />
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.<BR /> 
This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.<BR />
E.g. let's start with the number 0837:<BR />
8730-0378=8352<BR />
8532-2358=6174

6174 is called the <b>Kaprekar constant</b>. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the <b>Kaprekar routine</b>.

We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.<BR /> 
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.<BR >
However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3&ne;9, a Kaprekar constant exists.<BR />
E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)<sub>15</sub><BR />
base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)<sub>21</sub>

Define <var>C<sub>b</sub></var> to be the Kaprekar constant in base <var>b</var> for 5 digits.
Define the function <var>sb(i)</var> to be
<ul> 
<li> 0 if i = <var>C<sub>b</sub></var> or if <var>i</var> written in base <var>b</var> consists of 5 identical digits
<li> the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base <var>b</var> to arrive at <var>C<sub>b</sub></var>, otherwise
</ul>
Note that we can define <var>sb(i)</var> for all integers <var>i</var> &lt; <var>b</var><sup>5</sup>. If <var>i</var> written in base <var>b</var> takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.
</P>
<P>
Define <var>S(b)</var> as the sum of <var>sb(i)</var> for 0 &lt; <var>i</var> &lt; <var>b</var><sup>5</sup>.<BR >
E.g. S(15) = 5274369<BR /> 
S(111) = 400668930299
</P>
<P>
Find the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 &le; k &le; 300.<BR />
Give the last 18 digits as your answer.
