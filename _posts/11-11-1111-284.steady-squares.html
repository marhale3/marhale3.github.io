<p>The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same digits: 376<sup>2</sup> = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a steady square.</p>

<p>Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady square: c37<sup>2</sup> = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same numbering system. The letters a, b, c and d are used for the 10, 11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the hexadecimal numbering system.</p>

<p>For 1 &le; n &le; 9, the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 (582 decimal). Steady squares with leading 0's are not allowed.</p>

<p>Find the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system for<BR>
1 &le; n &le; 10000 (decimal) and give your answer in the base 14 system using lower case letters where necessary.</p>
