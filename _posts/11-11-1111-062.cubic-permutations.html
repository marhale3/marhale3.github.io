<p>The cube, 41063625 (345<sup>3</sup>), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (384<sup>3</sup>) and 66430125 (405<sup>3</sup>). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.</p>
<p>Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.</p>
