<P>
When we calculate 8<sup>n</sup> modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7.<BR />
As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a <b>primitive root</b> of 11.<BR />
But there is more:<BR />
If we take a closer look we see:<BR />
1+8=9<BR />
8+9=17&equiv;6 mod 11<BR />
9+6=15&equiv;4 mod 11<BR />
6+4=10<BR />
4+10=14&equiv;3 mod 11<BR />
10+3=13&equiv;2 mod 11<Br />
3+2=5<BR />
2+5=7<BR />
5+7=12&equiv;1 mod 11.
</P>
So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8<sup>n</sup> + 8<sup>n+1</sup> ≡ 8<sup>n+2</sup> (mod 11).<BR />
8 is called a <b>Fibonacci primitive root</b> of 11.<BR />
Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.<BR />
There are 323 primes less than 10000 with one or more Fibonacci primitive roots and the sum of these primes is 1480491.<BR />
Find the sum of the primes less than 100,000,000 with at least one Fibonacci primitive root.
